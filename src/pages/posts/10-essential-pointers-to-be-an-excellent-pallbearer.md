*How to can I be a great pallbearer?* **Fulfill your role during the visitation and funeral while being punctual, respectful, and professional. 1. Accept or decline the invitation to participate based on your availability. 2. Get a haircut. Make sure you are properly groomed for the occasion. 3. Get a suit. Make sure you are properly dressed. 4. No new girlfriends. Unless you are in a long-standing relationship, engaged, or married plan to attend alone. 5. On-time. Do not show up late for any part of this occasion. 6. Instructions. Get directions from the funeral home staff on the order of events. 7. Serve. Be available to assist in any capacity as you are needed. 8. Etiquette. Do not make a spectacle of yourself. 9. Pay attention. Don't get distracted and miss your ques. 10. Say goodbye. Make sure to stay a few minutes after the graveside service.**

## **Congratulations! Now what?**

So you've been selected to be a pallbearer. Well, first take a deep breath. **This is an honor for you and a memory you will cherish for years to come.** Let's not let worry turn this experience into a horrible memory.

**It is not terribly difficult to be a PB.** You just need to remember a few simple things. If you are wondering what it is exactly that being a pallbearer entails I will explain it very quickly.

A PB is someone who has been selected by the family to help carry the casket from the funeral home to the hearse and then from the hearse to the gravesite. Typically, there are six people selected for this role.

There are times when there may be one or two extra PBs walking out in front of the casket as the other six carry it. These individuals are referred to as "Honorary Pallbearers".

They simply "escort" the casket. **There is no set number of PBs that a family can select but it is pretty common to have six to eight for the average funeral.** It will depend greatly on the arrangements and type of burial that the family has selected.

In a memorial service where there are ashes from someone who has been cremated, there may be a special person selected to carry the urn. This function is similar to a traditional PB.

You only need to understand which role you will be performing and what the order of events is for the ceremony. **The funeral home staff will assist you with this so don't sweat the details.** I will go through all of that a little later.

So without further delay let's get onto the business of making sure that you have the tools to be the best pallbearer you can be.

## **1.Accept or Decline**

Hopefully, you did this before you accepted the honor of being a PB. Selecting or finding people to do this can be a task for some families. Either there are too many people to choose from or not enough.

In both circumstances, people's schedules play a big part in these decisions. It's not always possible for every person to get time off work or rearrange their life to attend these occasions. You want to consider this before you commit.

The reason I say this is because once you've accepted the family will move on to make their other arrangements that are based in part on your commitment to attend. **If you call at the last minute to cancel, it will be near impossible to replace you.**

Look at your schedule and make sure there is nothing to prevent you from fulfilling your role as a PB before you commit. **There is absolutely nothing wrong with turning down the opportunity if you can not make arrangements to be there.**

It is actually the most honorable thing you can do in those circumstances. The family would much rather receive an honest "no" than to have a wishy-washy "yes". "Let your yes be yes and your no be no."

## **2. Get a hair cut**

If you have attended any funerals in your life then you have likely seen the person who looked like they rolled out of bed and came to the service. Trust me when I say that you do not want to do this as a PB.

**Make sure you are groomed before you attend.** That means spending some time taking a bath, combing your hair, trimming your beard, and possibly shaving. Save your sexy stubble for date night with your wife.

Don't be afraid to reach for the cologne bottle and deodorant as well. Now look, don't take a bath in your perfume. You want just enough to smell good. If you start with bathing, you will find it doesn't take that much cologne to smell good.

This may all seem very obvious but you would be surprised. Common sense isn't so common anymore. The key is to look your best. Pretend your picture is going to be taken afterward if you have to.

Once you step into the funeral home as a PB you are a representation of the family. We want to make sure that we make the best impression we can with visitors and other family members. **The extra care you take in your appearance will communicate your respect.**

## **3. Get a suit**

Very closely associated with your "shave and a hair cut" is the clothes you wear. In some cases, the family may have made arrangements for the PBs to wear a certain style of suit or tux. This is not typically the case.

In most circumstances, you will need to provide your own suit. Yes, you need to get a suit if you don't have one. **The style needs to be business formal.** Don't wear a tux unless otherwise directed by the family.

A plain black suit with a black tie is perfectly acceptable. If you do not wish to wear all black, then wear a black tie with a black blazer. Blue jeans are not appropriate unless it's all you can afford. If you bring that fact to the attention of the family they may help provide you with a suit.

"Why black?" you ask. Well, again a PB you are representing the family. **The traditional color of a family that is grieving is black.** If you take issue with wearing black, then speak with the person that invited you to get instructions on what is an acceptable alternative.

There are many resale and discount clothing stores where you can find perfectly good suits for a very reasonable price. Slacks and blazers are passable if you have them already. Again, I would suggest you endeavor to get a suit.

**Being a PB is an honorable role in the service.**You can show the family how much you appreciate the invitation by spending a little money on some nice clothes in return.

## **4. No new girlfriends**

A funeral home is not a place to bring your new girlfriend. You may be very proud of her and she is probably a very nice person, but it is very tacky. Unless she is your fiance' it may be better to fly solo.

**We don't want to draw attention away from the family and the departed.** Bringing your new squeeze is likely to create a lot of waves. It may not even be negative attention. The fact is, that you and your girlfriend may pull the focus away from what is important. The family.

Now, I say this with some grace because quite a few couples these days choose to date for long periods before they either become engaged or get married. In those cases, your girlfriend may have a long-standing relationship with the family and it would be no different than bringing your wife in that regard.

Just make sure that is the case and it is indeed appropriate to bring her with you. There is nothing wrong with asking permission from the family either. If they say it is ok then it's ok. The point is to err on the side of being respectful.

You also want to consider that your new girlfriend will likely not know anyone and will be very uncomfortable away from your presence. This could prove to be a distraction for you in performing your role as a PB. You may miss your queues tending to her needs if you aren't careful.

## **5. Be on time**

Speaking of missing your queues, the only thing worse is for you to show up late. If you're running behind schedule getting to the visitation, it may slide with the family. However, being late to the funeral service is never acceptable as a PB.

**This is the most significant event in the family's life to this point, and when you are late it communicates an attitude of indifference.**Basically, you are saying that this wasn't important enough to you for you to plan ahead.

Being punctual to both the visitation and the funeral service will send the appropriate message. It will tell the family in so many words that you cared so much that you made sure not to allow any interruptions to keep you from being there for them.

**Non-verbal communication comprises about 80% of all communication between people.**In light of that fact, the very last message we want to send to the family is that we do not care. We care very much about them and for them in this time of grieving.

Being on time for both the visitation and the funeral is an excellent way to tell the family just that. You know that your presence is desirable because of the invitation to be a PB. So use the opportunity to "pay your respects" by being on time.

## **6. Get instructions for yourself**

**Each and every funeral home is going to strive to make this the best experience possible for the grieving family.** Making sure that the PBs know how vital their role is and how to perform it with precision is no exception to that.

In all of my personal experiences, I have never seen the funeral home staff miss the opportunity to pull the PBs aside for a private meeting to give them the order of events. It is always in the staff's best interest to make sure that PBs know exactly what to do and when to do it.

**Any interruption or mishap during the service will likely raise questions with the family as to what happened.**Especially those members who are super vigilant about such interruptions. After all, funerals are not cheap and we all want to receive the very best value for our money.

In light of that, most funeral homes strive to ensure that there are zero unexpected wrinkles in the order of the service. That means you will be able to count on the staff to lead you in the right direction no matter what type of service you are PBing for.

Any member of the funeral home staff will be able to answer your questions in detail and walk you through step by step scenario. These instructions may vary depending on what type of arrangements the family has made for the service. Therefore, rely on their expertise.

**If you have questions direct them toward the staff or the director of the funeral home.** Just because your uncle is the honorary PB doesn't mean he was listening perfectly during the meeting. Get your information first hand. It may save you embarrassment.

## **7. A servant's heart**

Ok. Let's recap. You have accepted, bathed, shaved, dressed, arrived on time, and received your instructions. Now what? **Make yourself available to serve the family in any way you can.**

This will be your primary function during the visitation. You will likely be sitting for most of the funeral depending on the type of service with exception to performing your PB duties. However, you will have a great opportunity during the visitation to serve.

I'll cover briefly some of the things you could do here but if you want a detailed look at what you can do at the visitation check out my article "What do you do at a visitation".

It is always a good idea for you to "pay your respects" to the family as soon as you arrive at the visitation. This will allow you to ask how you can be of service to them. They may have you speak with one of the other PBs or they may tell you themselves.

Do as you are directed and do not disappear. The point of you being invited was for you to be present. You may find yourself doing other things to help out such as:

* Greeting
* Taking out trash
* Cleaning
* Escorting the elderly
* Fetching things

etc...

The whole point is to be a servant while you are at the funeral home. If you need to, pretend you are a new member of the funeral home staff. The flunky. You get the jobs nobody else wants and that's ok. You are not here for you but for the family.**Do it with a smile.**

You may not be asked to do much or may not be asked to do anything at all. If that's the case be vigilant to look for ways you can help regardless. In between serving you should be visiting and friendly with other folks. **This is a great opportunity to pay your respects by serving any way you can.**

## **8. Behave yourself**

As you make your way around the funeral home to visit and interact with people, be mindful of your body language and your tone. As mentioned earlier, non-verbal communication is 80% of all communication.**We don't want to unintentionally send the wrong message.**

Again, if you need to, conduct yourself as though you were a member of the funeral home staff. Once you put the PB decoration on, you immediately become a representation of the family and the funeral home.

You simply want to make sure that your conduct reflects both parties in an honorable way. Don't be the guy telling dirty jokes in the hallway right outside the viewing room.**PBs need to be exemplary in how they carry themselves.**This would include silencing your phone and checking it only as needed.

This would not be the appropriate time to see if you can beat your record score on "candy crush". If you are feeling bored, it may be time to once again to see if there is anything you can do to serve.

When it comes to the actual funeral service, there should be a pretty regimented order of events. This won't leave you with much idle time. If you are quiet and follow the instructions given to you by the staff, things will likely go pretty smoothly. Behave as if Jesus was present and you should be fine.

## **9. Pay attention**

Now the time has come for you to bring your best game. Do not let yourself be distracted during the funeral service. The ques that you get may not be very obvious. So pay attention to the staff and your fellow PBs.

As I mentioned earlier, any hiccup in the service from inattention is likely to make waves with the family. We do not want that to happen simply because we were daydreaming or playing with our phones. **A good rule of thumb with your phone is to purpose not to check it once the funeral has begun.**

You will have the opportunity to glance at it later. As the funeral service comes to a close your focus needs to be on fulfilling your role as a PB. After all, that is the reason you are here.

Depending on the type of service you will be participating in, services can last between 30-60 minutes. This greatly depends on the wishes of the family and the number of speakers, songs, poems, and such. There may even be a photo slide.

If you become emotional at any point during the service that is absolutely fine. Being a PB does not mean being a robot. Grieve as you feel you need to and then compose yourself so you do not miss your ques. There will be more opportunities for you to have closure at the graveside service.

One more thing I want to mention here. **Once you are at the gravesite, watch your step.** You will be helping to lift the casket which is likely to be heavy. Make sure you have solid footing with each step. The last thing you want to do is to get unintentionally injured while serving.

## **10. Say your goodbyes**

Once you have performed your duty as a PB to help put the casket in place you aren't completely done. **You will want to show respect by staying for the entire graveside service and possibly shake hands with those who have attended.**

Now, do this only as the opportunity presents itself. This will not be like leaving the church where the pastor stands at the back thanking everyone for coming. You mainly want to make sure that you thank the family for involving you and express what an honor it was.

Be sensitive to the atmosphere here though. If the family is overcome with grief, this may not be the appropriate time. You may want to let them grieve and express your thanks at a later date. This greatly depends on your relationship with the family.

The point of staying a few minutes after the service has concluded is that we don't want to be seen running off. Take the time to thank the staff if they are still present. Shake hands with your fellow PBs. All of you are likely breathing a sigh of relief that nothing went wrong.

Most importantly, make sure you have had the appropriate time to say goodbye to your loved one in your own way. As you remove your PB decoration, say a prayer and thank God for the opportunity to do this. Allow yourself to grieve and get the closure you need. After all, this was a loss for you as well.

In conclusion, if you want to be the best PB you can be all you need to have is have the upmost respect for the family and the departed. Also, never hesitate to ask us any questions.**We are here to serve you.**
