*What do I do at a visitation?* **You pay your respects to the surviving family. 1. Condolences. Greet those who have experienced loss and offer them your sympathy. 2. Relationships. Spend time meeting new people and reminiscing with those you know. 3. Gifts. Ask the staff at the funeral home where to place any gifts you've brought. 4. Decorum. Be sure not to make a spectacle of yourself. 5. Leave. Show respect by not overstaying your welcome.**

## **"I am so sorry for your loss"**

Some families have extremely different ways of approaching death and we want to be sensitive to that. However, you can have confidence that if the visitation has been scheduled, then the family wants everyone to have the opportunity for closure.

"Visitation" simply means the family that has experienced loss has set aside a specific time for any friends, extended family, and/or acquaintances to "pay their respects".

Another way to see a visitation may be to look at it sort of like a church service. Churches typically do not send out a personal invitation to people, however, they do post their service times for everyone to know. This is because everyone is welcome to come during those times.

You have full access to all of the church's faculties during that time frame as well. It is much the same as a "visitation". The funeral home has worked with the grieving family to establish a time where you are welcome to come and participate.

"Participate in what?" you may ask. Participate in "paying your respects" to the family of the departed. That may look a little different for each family and in some cases, the atmosphere may be somber and very grievous. In others, it may celebratory.

You will need to be sensitive to that "feeling" as you arrive and begin making your way to greet the family. A few good questions to ask yourself before you arrive are:

* **How old was the departed?**
* **How did the departed pass?**
* **Was the passing expected or unexpected?**

Asking yourself those questions will give you a good idea of what to expect the atmosphere to be like. I say that as a general rule but it is a safe way to make sure you are as respectful as possible. You want to make sure you err on the side of "respectful".

Our goal is to convey our sympathy to the family in a kind and honorable way. We do not want to create an unintended offense by being insensitive to the level of grief the family is feeling. We are there to be supportive. Not instructive. Leave that to the ministers.

## **"I haven't seen you in a month of Sundays"**

One of the very best things for you to plan to do while at the visitation is to spend time catching up with those you haven't seen in a while. A familiar face is nearly always a welcome comfort in times of grief.

You may carry a memory of the departed with you that the family is very fond of. On seeing you that memory will comfort them. Make it your business to be available to reminisce with those who are grieving.

Talking is an excellent way to handle a loss. Now look, don't be that person that walks around interrupting and forcing conversations with people. I'll touch on being obnoxious in a little bit. You simply want to make yourself available to anyone who may want to share stories with you.

There will likely be others at the visitation that you have never seen before in your entire life. Chances are they are feeling a little uncomfortable the same as you. They may be unsure of what to say or how to say it. This would be a great opportunity to make their acquaintance.

A comforting sight to a grieving family is to see those who came to pay their respects standing around talking to one another. It gives a sense of catharsis to know that their departed loved one had so many friends and acquaintances.

**It's never a good idea to show up, shake hands, eat cake, and then leave.**Be polite. Have several conversations with folks you may not know. They may need to talk as much as the family who experienced loss. You never know. Everyone gets closure in their own way.

Now, remember we are primarily here to "pay our respects" not to mingle and hobnob. I'm not telling you to "work the room" like you're campaigning for office. I'm merely saying that you should be available to show love to those who need it and be willing to be loved in return.

## **I brought a cake!**

Ok, this is a pet peeve of mine so please give me some grace here. Please please do not burst through the doors and announce that you've brought cake. It's a very nice thing to bring gifts to the visitation but don't sound a trumpet before yourself.

I would advise that you do the very opposite of that and very discreetly ask a member of the funeral home staff where the gifts go. They will be able to tell you exactly what to do.

The staff is there to take care of such things for the family so they may grieve with as few disturbances as possible. In fact, most of the things you will encounter at a visitation have been arranged by the family and performed by the funeral home staff behind the scenes.

Now, what kind of gifts are appropriate for a visitation? Well, here are a few. I would stay pretty close to this list:

* **Flowers** - the colors are not extra important
* **Cards** - very appropriate for friends and acquaintances
* **Food** - finger foods are the most appropriate

If you have an heirloom that you want to return to the family or some other special kind of gift, present it to the family in a different setting. The visitation is not the appropriate time to bring a flag or medal of honor.

Those types of items should be given to the family soon after the death sometime before the visitation if possible. If not, you may want to try and get your gift to them between the visitation and the funeral if you can. If that can not be arranged, wait till a later date.

## **This is about the family**

The reason I suggest being so discreet in both your interactions and the presenting of your gifts is because we don't want to draw attention to ourselves. The focus should remain on the family and the departed.

Some folks will use the visitation time as an opportunity to make a spectacle of themselves. You've seen this before I am sure. We do not want to be the obnoxious person arguing about politics in the hall so loudly the family can't hear the folks greeting them near the casket.

It is a comforting thing to hear friends and family laughing and talking. So please don't hear me in the wrong way. There is a line that you have to be sensitive to that is not always that obvious. The best thing to do is err on the side of "respectful".

Here's a checklist of things that may help you figure this out:

* Are you dressed appropriately and conservatively?
* Are you speaking at a normal volume?
* Are your jokes appropriate for mixed company?
* Are you leaving enough food for other people?
* Are you being brief and quiet in the viewing room?
* Are you going outside to smoke?
* Are you sober, shaved, and groomed?

Some of those may seem ridiculous but you would be surprised. Remember that this moment is about the family and the departed and not about you. Lay aside any "agenda" you may have and simply be there for them. You will have time to work out things or give special gifts later.

## **So long, farewell**

So now it's time to go. You have made your way around the funeral home several times and you've been to the viewing room a couple of times as well. Be respectful as you exit and say goodbye to anyone you may pass by and leave.

Now, if you have received an invitation to attend the funeral it may be appropriate for you to stay long enough to find out some of the details. In some cases, the family will extend the opportunity to attend the funeral to everyone present.

If that is the case, there will likely be a bulletin of some kind showing the order of events. If there is not, a member of the funeral home staff can give you any information you require.

The point is that we do not want to be going in and out of the viewing room like we own the place or "hanging around" unnecessarily. If you have "paid your respects" and visited for a little while, then you have likely done what you have come to do.

Visitations can be exhausting for the family because each person represents another memory for them to process.**We want to be sensitive to that.** After all, the family still has the funeral to do.

Again, all families handle grief differently. You may be asked to stay as long as you like. Just remember to be "respectful" and not to overstay your welcome. If you pay attention to the atmosphere, you will know when it's time to go.

So, I hope that helps you to know how you should approach a visitation. This is your chance to say goodbye so take the opportunity to do so. If you have more questions, do not hesitate to ask us. **We are here to serve you.**
